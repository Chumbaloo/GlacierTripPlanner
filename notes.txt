To find a route...
    Give start and end points
    Find all segments that connect to the start point
        Check if length is <16
            If yes, then continue
            If no, discard
        Check if these segments end at a campground or trailhead
            If yes, store as possible route
            If no, find all segments that connect to the END of the hung segment and add segments together
            (do not allow backtracking. If no connected segments, then discard)
                repeat steps 4 through 8 until length is >16, or it ends at a campground
